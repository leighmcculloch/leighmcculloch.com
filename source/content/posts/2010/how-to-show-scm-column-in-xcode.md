I have been using Source Control Management with Xcode for the last 6 months or so. But setting up a new project I've only had to do a couple of times. And every time I always come across some kind of difficulty with showing the SCM Column on the left of Xcode in the Groups and Files view. This post is really here so that the next time I do a search I can find the info I need easily :D

After having setup SCM with XCode the SCM Smart Group wasn't showing on the left. But I couldn't figure out how to get it to show, last time I did this it showed automatically. The trick is to Right Click on the Groups & Files heading and select SCM in the list. Yay! How easy was that?
